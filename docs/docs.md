## about the project

## Notes

- The majority of current text analytical
  tools operating on social media datasets
  are disproportionally focused on sentiment
  analysis or polarity of opinions (positive,
  negative, or neutral)
- The metadata associated with social media
  activity specifies the creation of a post/tweet/
  check-in to the second and it is then up to the
  researcher to decide at what temporal level
  the data is aggregated. For example, does it
  make sense to plot sentiment around a specific event for every second or should a summary sentiment score be computed by minute, hour,
  day, week or month? For studies with a
  high n during a short burst of time a smaller
  aggregation may be appropriate, but for other
  studies where cases are limited it may be
  necessary to summarize data over a longer
  period.

- Sentiment analysis is an
  extremely popular text classification technique because the tone of text can convey a
  lot of information about the subject‚Äôs perspective and lead to aggregate analyses of
  reviews, message polarity, or reactions.

- the complexities and nuances
  inherent in language context make sentiment analysis less straightforward than spam
  detection.

- Sentiment analysis refers to the process of
  computationally identifying and catego‚Äê
  rizing emotional polarity expressed in an
  utterance‚Äîe.g., to determine the relative
  negativity or positivity of the writer or
  speaker‚Äôs feelings.
