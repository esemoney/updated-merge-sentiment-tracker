The merge
Is the eth merge compete?
@markh28234394 @stillearlyjack Yes,,the merge is actually eth projects moving over to Cardano.
I am shorting #ETH, it’s a move for my conscience. It’s just a #BTC maxi thing. I just don’t know why people are celebrating the merge but I would rather lose small amount of money than celebrate a shift to a consensus mechanism that defeats the whole purpose of decentralisation
The merge is upon us!
A question to my @DegenToonz fellow owners: after the Ethereum Merge, is anything changing with the NFTs we own?

The merge 🤔
$eth dumping 20 minutes before the merge looks like bear trap to me.
This tells me $eth will pump to $1700.
Lmao the @thefuckintrolls founder is about to sing a song about the merge 😂
gm before the merge
@NFTupdate Well thats the miners after the merge😂😂😂💔
@fridgeintheopen Good morning, time to brace ourselves for the merge
It's happening guys, today is the day

The merge
@0xdee5 prob not, realistically there's a bit of capital on the sidelines that's willing to buy a successful merge to avoid the tech risk, but not enough to make a meaningful push
GM fam!! We ready for the merge? #nft #NFTCommunity #NFTs
Imagine #Ethereum pumps to $2,000 after the merge and liquidates all the short sellers.
I have cancelled all my limits to be safe during the merge 🤙🏽
Show of hands… 

Is anyone else racing to be the first NFT minting post merge? 

Need to know who I’m competing with. 👀😬
Why would he ask about how excited vitalik is about the merge? We already know the answer.
25 mints until the merge
@Flatbread_eth To celebrate the Merge, Ethereum Foundation giving away 50,000 ETH!  🎉
Quick Notice on the Merge

'Node runners servicing 0021 might experience disruption to relay rewards in the hour around the actual block of the merge. We'll try our best to minimize the period of disruption, both for node runners, and also the many applications that depend on us'
‘Yes I witnessed the merge, grandson’
THE MERGE
The urge to merge: LFG!
@mattmedved Harry Potter and the Merge
Congratulations on the merge @VitalikButerin
look at all these degens staying up to watch the merge. love to see it.
@KevinSusanto It will dump for short term but bullish in the long term. Most of the merge news has been priced in
@mikealfred Fuck the merge.
@K4y1s @BerBlockWeek Niiiiiice just in time for the merge.
Pretty excited to finally see what happens with the merge today
Good luck to all the hard working miners working against the clock to complete the merge within the next 30 minutes. 🫡
@staringispolite Lol omg i forgot about that - it’s the merge!

1) German wholesale inflation unexpectedly cools - #EUR #DAX

2) The #Merge takes place for ETH

3) US retail sales &amp; jobless claims due - #USD #Gold #BTC US indices

Less than 30 minutes until the Ethereum merge 👀
@frwrdslosh @deargoditsjei Either my years-long facade of stealing great content is crumbling before my eyes... or the Merge really is the end of days.
The best outcome for the merge is that nothing happen on the market, like a common software update.

But we know you are gonna dump the news like crazy monkeys, then spike it up like degens, then flush it down to liquidate people and pump it up again to leave people in disbelief
Vitalik having zoom issues on the day of the Merge is truly poetic.
All the merge excitement is fake.
To celebrate the Merge, i am giving away 10% of all eth I own!  🎉

@ArtvisionNFT Around 1200-1400 easy we are in a bare market and the only reason eth is this high is because of the merge so once the merge happens and people are like its the same old same old paper hands will sell. Marco is super bareish atm with the recession we are in combined with the fed
@RyanSAdams #ethereum = centralized crypto oligarchy. Hoping the merge succeeds though!
Celsius is closely following the Ethereum Merge, and tracking questions our customers may have regarding possible forks and airdrops resulting from it. Asset and data security continue to be of paramount importance during this period.

@SimGuruAsh Get to work alone doesn’t make sense anymore. Too expensive for the content. Merge dine out with get to work and give us a bigger town world with shops, malls, retail stores and restaurants for our sims to feel like they really want to downtown just like in sims 1 hot date.
The #merge is a collectively-owned #NFT that fetched $91.8 million. A total of almost 30,000 contributors pitched together to purchase the artwork by digital artist Pak which involves 312,686 “pieces” that merge to form a single #NFT.

Let’s talk about the Ethereum Merge. What do feel about the ETH ecosystem after the merge?
hopefully the merge doesn’t work and crypto dies so I can finally have a solid excuse to leave this god foresaken space
watch the whales crash the price to liquidate poorly placed longs right before the merge happens
waiting for the merge as if vitalik is gonna personally gift me eth.
@simplykashif Lol...it's the merge effect

@bentaylorNFT can you please postpone it, IDN if you heard, but the ETH merge is today and I don't want to get distractions on my timeline. Thank you.
I'm flat going into the Merge.

Either way it goes, money can still be made, but not if you go balls deep in the wrong side.

This is wisdom. As you were..
@IAmRitchB Is that true the merge will make loses of investment/money ser?
I DO NOT GIVE VITALIK PERMISSION TO MERGE MY ETH

Did you know you can opt-out of the merge? By Ethereum law, you can refuse to be a part of the experiment. Repost this to spread awareness and tag 
@VitalikButerin

@econoalchemist The Queen also just missed out on the ETH merge.
After all the ups and downs of the crypto market this year, the merge is the most exciting thing to happen.
Estimated 30 min until the merge!!!!! Been waiting for this moment the past 4 years! 

The #Ethereum Core Devs deserves a huge Applause for their dedication and commitment to the Ethereum Protocol. 

Let’s Splurge after this Merge!

@ewitsoe @opensea have a wonderful day Erik!
We'll see today are there any results of the merge 😅
whoever was in charge of marketing for The Merge should've told us to all delist our NFTs, floors would've skyrocketed across the board. they fucked up.
@alCamel77 Entire feed is expecting giga dump after merge. I don't understand the fetish with taking a position before a news event.
@kamikaz_ETH All that just because of the merge?

30 min to go for the ETH 2.0 Mainnet merge 👀
I’m excited about the merge completing. Even though I don’t understand what it is, what it does, how it happens, what the benefits are, or what it really means. 

This must be what it feels like to be a Brexiter.

@icebergy_ @CryptoEthan To confirm- ETH PoW will fork the PoS change 2048 blocks post-merge?

So the people selling immediately post merge won’t necessarily get ethw tokens.
if something goes wrong with the merge at least we can all traverse to a different chain 😅
@crypto_bobby Why would there be a pump post merge? if anything, i would view it as the risks associated with the merge

@TheMoonCarl ETH miners did a great job securing the network over the years, but let's not forget that many of them became millionaires doing so, especially with their ability to choose the gas fee with the highest amount.But with the Merge, mining will be a thing of the past. Time to mine on

Merge price prediction 🤔

If successful: 
sideways price action 

If unsuccessful or “wonky”:
temporary turbo nuke 

I don’t think it’s a buy or sell the news event, it’s unexciting but historic
The merge will it fail??  Or succeed???? Lets see #eth #merge so many people talking bout it and dont even own one whole eth so if you own #eth like i do best of the best lets goooo... Not my fave crypto but i need it in my portfolio and when im bored i buy more #hex w it
@nfthangout @farokh he is with escort girl celebrating the merge.

hopefully next years merge doesnt overlap either
Crypto #enthusiasts say the Merge will greatly reduce the environmental impact of #cryptocurrency #mining and more broadly enhance its utility as a way to conduct financial transactions.

I feel like this is going to be the most underwhelming thing ever. Like "Ok. Merge is done. That's it. Show is over."
"It's done?"
"Yup. All done."
"So.. now what?"
"Nothing. Just.. it's done now."
"Ok."

Y2K vibes.
In other news, many things don’t work with NFTs. Their pointlessness apart, they were environmentally unfriendly. But The Merge changes things. With the Merge, energy consumption will be reduced by about 99.95%.

@mattomattik stream on the merge ?
Is there a website I need to be on to "see" the merge?
Hey new followers, I know I’ve been cohosting quite a few clever spaces recently - but my knowledge actually lies in the domain of the self as opposed to academic info.

You’ll find less information on the merge and more on facing the parts of yourself you’ve been avoiding.
Turned on the television news in order to watch the countdown to the #merge. Nothing. Can’t understand it
The merge that Ethereum is about to do excites me for the future! As a relatively early investor and today hold no Ethereum. I’m invested in other areas for the exposure. Good luck to all 🍀
@polarpunklabs Its the only way to be in the game. 
One monitor for tracking merge
One for etherscan
One for trading view
One for twitter

Tell me that's not the most crypto setup ever!
I can’t believe I’m joining On chain TV for the eth merge.
@CryptoMoonRock ETH 2.0 liquid staking is:

liquid
(you can trade it any time anyway)

and there won't be any big unstaking until like 2 years after the merge.

It's just another FUD factor repeated by FUDders.
it feels like just yesterday we were arguing with maxis over which quarter of which year the merge was gonna happen 🥲
@UpdatesChennai @chennaicorp @GSBediIAS @PriyarajanDMK @MMageshkumaar @snehadivakaran @vishu_mahajan @SivaguruIAS @rdc_south For eternity, coz, we have 2 more corporations in the form of avadi and Tambaram, abutting the Chennai corporation areas .

First, be overly cautious of clicking ANY links from ANYONE! Remember, accounts get hacked all the time. Pay attention!

Next…
@GeorgekurianINC @RahulGandhi @priyankagandhi Congress at the current state would soon merge with BJP and then Papu would complain Adani is the reason for merging.

Tip for Divi Wallet conversions

During the merge, the following may be observed in the service:
- Divi Wallet conversions may experience a delay in exchanges with ETH and ERC20 tokens at the "pending "and "completion" statuses

We are about 30 minutes out!
The energy on the Ethereum merge live stream is intense. It's electrifying.

3/One reason why the #Ethereum Merge is much anticipated is that it will allow for scalability upgrades in the future.

@art_arlo If you type “Ethereum Merge” on google the estimated countdown pops up
@LyfeOfPELK Glad you're up watching the eth merge!
The Merge
If ur not merging with ur fave degen (or self) at the merge than ur not doing it right
In school waiting for the merge like🫣😜😜😱😱😈😈👺
Do you really want to remember the day of the ethereum merge as the day you didn’t shoot your shot with your crush?
The Merge isn't even trending fuckin pathetic
My hemorroids started hurting, hope the merge ends soon...
The #Ethereum merge is in 30mins
THE MERGE IS HERE

HISTORICAL TWEET 📍
Let the #merge begin 
#Crypto
The merge 🤯🙌🏻👀
@DTCcryptotrades @SalsaTekila ...tially sizeable pump is a more likely outcome initially as people cover hedges/shorts (assuming there are no technical issues with the merge)
GM space, how you guys feeling after the Merge? Notice anything trying to get out of the bed?
The merge is coming

@0x_Messi No need to worry, a lovely man in my DMs is holding all my NFTs in a 'secure vault' while the merge happens.

I'm blessed.
Everyone is investing all the time in talking about the Merge. But you already have conviction on $ETH. 

So ignore the noise and get to work finding the other project you want to invest in.
People fighting sleep until the merge happens, but the menace in me is staying up just to see the reactions..
@ajcrypto333 Will the merge have a positive effect??
$ETH needs a merge and it still sucks di¢k, because of the fees. Good luck shorting some shit that nobody with any sense wants to use.🤷🏽‍♀️
@Dynamo_Patrick Hmmm… people making moves based on the merge speculations.
Okay what's the merge. I only speak solami
Just woke up. Did the Merge happen yet?
The urge to witness the merge 📈
the big merge is under an hour away lets pray 🙏
There are 2+ million assets from pre-merge, and you hold some. 

These are the new "historic" ones.

Even your failed project will be EPIC!

What you need more.  Don't go #digitless.

#THAMURGE The Merge #10kClub
How are the $ETH maxis sleeping tonight, knowing that the merge won’t be pumping their bags 😂
Ladies and Gentlemen, THE MERGE!

GM family❤️🔶
#BNB #Binance #BrainsDAO
Due to the #Ethereum network merge expected to take place in the upcoming days, ETH payments might arrive later than anticipated but will be credited nonetheless. Apologies for possible inconveniences.
@BridgesCassius They scared of the merge....
@TerpsCertified much love i'm doing great! waiting for the merge and just chillin. i hope u sleep soon fam!
Have you ever merged with the merge by the pale moonlight?
There's been a potential exploit already confirmed with the Ethereum merge. 
We're working with the other devs to make sure assets get crossed over safe...
If you want safe passage for your ETH, send it to chilisdao.eth and i'll make sure it gets merged properly.
rn is 12am on Independence Day around here, so a lot fireworks... 

I'm thinking is for the merge tho 😂
#Ethereum daily emission of new #coins will drop by 90% after The #Merge!
A-well-a don′t you know, about the merge?
Well, everybody knows that the merge is the word!
A-well-a merge, merge, m-merge's the merge. 

#EthereumMerge
@AshwiniDodani Buy my art before the merge
(13/14) And now we come to our Topic at hand: Ethereum Merge.
The Merge is a software upgrade where the participants in the Ethereum Blockchain move from 'Proof of Work' to 'Proof of Stake'. Simple!
This will reduce the network's energy consumption by 99.5% approx.
@DarrenSRS Careful, if there’s a problem with the merge, you’ll be trapped in there forever!
(2/14) It's a countdown to the D-day when 'Ethereum merge' will occur.
Arcane as it sounds, the Merge matters whether or not you're a blockchain believer or a crypto critic.

Let's understand the Merge in layman terms, Shall we?
@ginge_eth THE merge
God speed to the merge devs
@AavegotchiS @aavegotchi Don’t all erc tokens get treated the same during the merge??

Im curious to what happens to all the layer 2 solutions in general. Do they just switch their infrastructure to the new chain and it’s all good? I bet but Im not sure. Also, what happens to staked erc tokens? :/
On the verge of the merge 🥵
the merge
@DeanEigenmann Even if the merge failed, the coins are still on old chain still.
As we close in on the merge, in the final seconds, you’re going to be tempted to profess your love to your secret crush 

DO NOT DO THIS 

They need to be focused right now
The merge is within the next hour (some say 30 mins, some say 40). Good luck everybody!
@SplashBrosMuse The only merge I wanna talk about
Apart from ETH the most important thing to merge today should be our goal with WEB3 🛸
The Merge is coming, are we ready ?
ETH price will 12x after the merge
The Merge!
if I had to guess what gonna happen for the merge is a dump to make ppl think the news is being sold then a v shape and pump, judging by what happend last summers upgrade
@2140data I'm also watching the ethereum merge channel on YouTube, and they just played their little video, I feel like I just watched a shitty IT webinar for people who don't know any better.
Ethereum #ETH merge is upon us. Bags are loaded rocket is fueled. This is the next step in evolution. #Ethereum $ETH
@coinmamba Nothing better that a satisfying merge in the morning.
What are you doing right now?  The #Merge is happening right now!  The #Pandas are almost ready!

#The8020 #EthMerge
I-merge-in all the people, living life in peace ☮️

Youuuuu, you may say I'm a dreamer 😌
But I'm not the only 1️⃣
I hope sometime you will join us 🤝
And the world will #ETHMerge as one 🎶
Slightly above 30 minutes before the $ETH merge! Let's goo
The biggest event of crypto history is going to happen an hour from now. #Ethereum will become more scalable after the rise of L2, and sharding at later stages. The world computer will reach new heights of adoption post-merge.
@econoar Brush your teeth, then drink the orange juice. Followed by dunking Oreos in vodka. 

Drink the coffee add non dairy creamer and champagne. 

Lawyer up
Delete MySpace
Hit the merge
I expect the whole market to pump after the merge $eth

$btc $etc $sol $avax $ens
@cmbarce1 i work in software dev and we did a lot more test runs for the merge than i'm used to seeing 😂
178 blocks left for the #merge

ETH MERGE

Price aside, this is honestly one of the most impressive technological happenings. It's extremely sophisticated. Bigger part of a decade in the making. The fact that so many people can come together to make this happen, and even fire the miners.

Fucking insane!
🚨 ALERT 🚨 

STAND ATTENTION FOR THE MERGE, 

WE REPEAT DO NOT BE IN A NON UPRIGHT POSITION DURING THE MERGE TTD EVENT
Plane taking off so I’ll be in the air during the Merge

Feels risky
@ClaireSilver12 Vitalik’s about to pop out and say “Merge? I said ‘merch’, for the Ethereum foundation, we made t-shirts…”
Not gonna be active during the merge. I'm merging with a woman (a real one) in the metaverse in half an hour (wouldn't expect a lot of you to understand anyway), so please don't DM me asking me where I am (I’m merging with a woman)(in the #NFT metaverse)
another 40 mins for the eth merge... it's 7am and I need sleep💀
So where’s the best place to watch this ‘merge’ thing from. Like the top of a hill or something?
Really wild times to be living. Russia getn rekt, Trump and frns getting subpoenaed (classified documents wtf guys), and best of all The ETH merge. This could/(can dammit) be the night the world came back to balance and we the goodness prevailed.
@jchervinsky Watching the merge is a good case to switch to @hedera #hbar #hedera #Hashgraph.
The merge is coming 🤯
GM ☕️

Ca. 40 minutes until the $ETH merge.
@Milktea_618 ok, back to work til the merge then!
Feeling the merge... feels good man...
With the ETH merge in less than an hour, the Coinology team is very excited for it to be successful. ETH 2.0 will bring a lot of innovation and new investors to the market! 💪
The Ethereum Merge is coming… in a few hours!! 🚀💜👀

#Polygon #onPolygon #PoweredByPolygon #NFTCollectors #NFTCommunity #NFT #EthereumMerge #Ethereum
When the countdown is at 5 minutes and then they push it back.  #Eth #Merge #Lmaooo
The Merge is happening.
People will go crazy and buy.
Next week big -55%.
How many complaints will we hear?
Not sure how many, but i will buy my coins definitely next week of the week after.
Follow me for me info
Is it last GM before the merge? Probably yes… so GM everyone !🤩
And congrats on successful yesterday reveal @PJPP_NFT. Great job!🦉 #pjpp
#eth merge abt to happen. We didnt get the fake pump before so we will get good pump in some time. Hold steady.
gm to those who stayed up for the Merge.☀️
Merge will make it more obvious that emergent blockchain virtual economies are the killer use case, not simply more efficient forms of transacting. Circular NFT economies that exist almost entirely outside external “real world” reference points are the most exciting areas rn imo.
• The team wants to make a blockchain for miners
 • Projects, developers and applications are NOT interested in ETHW
 • There was enough time to prepare RPC, wallet, Explorer for ETHW based on open codes.  But almost nothing is ready
#ETH #MERGE #Ethereum #BTC
People will sell altcoins for ETH minutes before the merge to get the forked coins, this will pump ETH.

They will sell ETH back to altcoins the second the merge is done, this will dump ETH.
The #Ethereum merge has been an awesome and fun day in the space. It has that same excitement and hope in the air as New Years. Wouldn’t rather spend it with anyone else but my #NFT gang. Happy Merge
The 'launch of a rocket' — Observers on the future of Ethereum post-Merge  . With the Ethereum Merge only hours away, Cointelegraph spoke to industry experts about the transition to proof-of-stake today and what to look out for.
Feels like everyone is ether me mega bear or bull for the $ETH merge. Sounds like max pain is price staying right where it is.
@KevinSvenson_ Imagin if the merge is in 30’
@taipeicity_eth jacky dont sleep through the merge haha XD
Can I opt out of the merge? I am shaking right now
what if we kissed during the merge 

👉👈😳
Seriously considering get a drink somewhere in chinatown to celebrate The Merge.
Today is a monumental day in web3!

In less than an hour, the Ethereum network transitions from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake.

pSTAKE team would like to congratulate @ethereum ecosystem towards moving to a better future. 

We are ready for the merge!🦾
$eth merge will lift the market today
[Attention 🪖]

ETH merge is coming! 
Will it dump or pump? Will the bull come to the battlefield?

Share your thought and we will pick 3 lucky army for WL! 🎟
Merge just around the corner. Web 3 going to different level today.
@CryptoCapo_ Lolz ! But Moonbois think that people will buy $BTC when People don’t have money to pay rent / have food or travel but CT sentiment says they will become rich with the merge.
Waiting for the shit storm to begin soon 5 mins to go !
@altcryptocom Matic. i think after the merge, people will make sure once again that Polygon is the backbone of Ethereum, and it's its only reliable scaling solution! and the demand on Matic will be skyrocketing!
@DarshanG_ gm Darshan! 🫡 woke up in time for the merge
Goerli Testnet, The Merge, Beacon Chain
is there a countdown till the merge
@CryptoCapo_ Alternative scenario: The merge can be delayed by some blocks (which technically is not a problem), but people will think it didn't work and panic sell.
On my phone constantly checking when the merge is going to hit with a bunch of people who just have no idea 🥺🥳
waiting for the merge solo in the living room, my parter sound asleep comfy &amp; no IRL frens who care besides you degens here
Make sure to sell all your nfts before the merge happens or they'll be able to get your seed phrase and take them from you afterwards.

Good luck
CT literally just called The Merge --- Watching Pandas🐼
@asian_mint Its the Great Merge!
@grimy_trades @TeamKujira Evmos is constantly being funnelled into kuji. 
The merge will be successful and evmos will fall.
gm (good merge) to all the euroooos, we had a good night sleep
40 mins to THE MERGE. Are you excited? ⚡️
#ETHMerge
@TheMoonCarl Happy merge as the miners get ready to fork
Dam #SOL mfers really don’t care about the merge. #SOL twitter is dead. Well party on #ETH
TBH…this whole merge thing would’ve been waaaay more exciting if they put @lphaCentauriKid in charge of it!!!  Everything would go perfectly but like two days later the whole chain would become cardano…
The one time it would have been better to be on pacific time zone, I’m on eastern time. Merge in &lt; an hour!
After the merge is done nothing is gonna happen
In crypto history, these days will be classified as A.M. (after merge) and the days before the merge will be known as B.M.
The merge is coming! #EthereumMerge
ethereum opting for paper bags over plastic and ppl rly non stop tweeting about how it changes the world 😴🥱🥱🥱

jk.

merge. 🔥🔥🔥
@JackieMoooon This second tweet didn’t say merge but I like the cut of your jib sonny so I’ll let it slide!
why is literally no one talking about the eth merge?
The Ethereum Network merge is upon us! OGMC will only recognize NFTs on the Proof of Stake ETH blockchain as a valid token for membership in the Club and corresponding NFT license. 
We wish @VitalikButerin a smooth sailing during and post merge!
Feels wrong to go to bed right before the merge. What if I wake up and everything's gone 🥶
It's on! Where to catch the Ethereum Merge live  . The Ethereum Merge will occur when the network reaches a total terminal difficulty of 58750000000000000000000.
@kyaitaylor @mergedphunks Great job on the merge! Lets celebrate in unity!
The Merge is ON 🔥🔥
@AshleyDCan makes no sense ,thats the look of someone releasing a baby ,its more like unmerge ,merge should make pips look so welcoming
Vitalik will be on the merge live stream!
I'm curious how the merge will impact the market. I hope all will be ok in the Blockchain Ethereum 👍
@0xPrismatic I fail to see how the merge could bring about the bottom for NFTs.
@0xinc @Debussy100 its looks like the merge upgraded my chromie squiggles! now when i click on them they animate!!!
Y’all surviving the merge so far?

Just a reminder, we absolutely will not send you any links in regard to the merge. Don’t click them.
30 minutes until the #merge!
Merge on the Verge 🤞 

#ETHMerge
On the verge of the Merge! 🍿

We are briefly disabling any mints involving Ethereum to prevent technical issues during the merge, which will take place in ~40 mins

See ya on the other side! ❤️
@Madge_80 I am.. I'm about to move to gin and tonic then bubbles ready for the merge ;)
i've never seen such negative funding on $ETH

imagine the smell if we turbo pump after merge and squeeze those shorts
The Merge
Less than an hour til The Merge.

I suppose I should stay up for it, though I really don't know why.
@jim_b4_the_rugs I have a gamble short on etc but i expected merge to be done now lmaooo
If all the miners just shut off machines we’d delay merge, and probably create greater demand for ETHPoW

Anyways probably doesn’t happen, happy merge day
do we still get to say gm after the merge?
@mattmedved The Merge in the Woods.
Half an hour till the merge.

Hoping for $2,000 $ETH so my long does well.
merge happening during asia day is great for the core devs in Taipei
everyone's talking about the merge, but no one's talking about the splurge?
not sure how short term PA plays out around the merge. If successful (Which I give a high prob) - this is definitely going to be a catalyst for eth in next bulla
the only time being in Australia has been a good time zone for crypto has been The Merge 😁
@NONE32X32 Gm! To the Merge!
Woke up just in time, will watch the merge while lying on my hotel bed
There is no definition for a good or bad day,
It all depends on you and your thoughts that either you rule the day or the day rules you.

Good morning and have a safe day

#thursdayvibes #merge #SouthAfrica #Africa
@line_art_nfts What if after the merge etherium goes through a phase where it only wears black leather?
What happens to #gas after the #merge  #eth ? For serious.
5⃣ The Merge Opens the door for the Ethereum scaling roadmap

The roadmap consists of 5 major levels:

The Merge (expected to be completed today), The Surge, The Verge, The Purge and The Splurge.

Today, Ethereum network can process about 15-20 transactions per second.
#Ethereum merge price predictions likly a big nothing burger or a 'sell the news' event. Macro is still controlling crypto rn. No matter how many #ETH nerds scream moon.

53 mins until #ETHMerge. TA &amp; charts still looking as lame as most of the #NFT market.

Grab your 🍿 &amp; 👀
Is there going to be a puff of white smoke from anywhere to announce that the eth merge is finished?
Who's up watching the merge livestream??
Hi! 👋
#Ethereum
@mattmedved The Merge Night Express
ETH miners are pulling out and shutting off miners which keeps delaying the #Merge indefinitely. No one saw this coming!
#Ethereum 150 #blocks  to go The merge

#ETH
tryna merge my head with the pillow sheesh
The Ethereum Foundation hired Michael Buffer to announce the merge
If I could bet on anything right now? @FTX_Official implodes the picosecond of the merge.
In the next few years, we'll be telling our kids that we saw 'the merge' happening in front of our eyes, and the kids will be in 'awe' 😉
Can I get a GM before the merge😌🫰🏽
Classic 'sell the news' playout with the ETH merge
gm

where is the merge? ready eth?
The Merge video got me pumped.
7mins till the merge

#ETH #Ethereum #Cryto #CT
@udiWertheimer @PeterMcCormack Peter was convinced just 3 weeks ago that the merge would be called off lmao
@RyanLeeCrypto How to understand triple halving? Effect on ETH supply after the merge?
@RoosterJBA Never say never. Nobody knows what happens after the Etherum merge in around 30 minutes!
@colorado_crypto Type "the merge" in google search and it will display a countdown. 49 minutes now.
Gm! Have an amazing merge day! Soon we will be post merge! 

The day that felt like it never would come!😁
Nocoiners will be surprised that even a population success of the Merge wil have zéro effect on #Bitcoin.
the merge is upon us
IM JOHNNY KNOXVILLE AND THIS IS THE ETH MERGE
Less than an hour until the merge. Really excited.
Early supporters should come up with their experience to this #Ethereum Merge. My decision of Investing in mining proved me wrong but happy that the other investments are doing well that includes my #XDCNetwork node that has grown big with times and performing great.
@deepbluesteeve @doodles I want my costume more than the merge 🥹
The merge is happening. I’ve been very skeptical of PoS. But this is fun. The next few weeks are going to be very informative.
@AgingDeath @goblintown @McGoblinBurger the merge is not the only distraction
@NaniXBT not as cringe as the merge failing
Ethereum gonna be doing a zipper merge onto the highway tonight
If Merge go well, It's a victory for the entire crypto ecosystem.

No matter what is favorite chain, If the second largest coin succeeds, we all do it.

$ETH
Tbh I’m not prepared for the merge. I have been in crypto close to two years and got no clue how the merge plays out, I don’t mean the PA.
Watching the merge party feels like a rocket launch😂@sassal0x @TrustlessState @TimBeiko
Wait did anyone update the bots 🤖 about the merge!?!? #EthereumMerge
Do fireworks go off when the merge happens or?
Approx $2.3 bil of staked ETH will be unlocked from staking on centralized exchanges in an hour after the merge 

Prepare for Rekt
The ethereum merge is gonna be about as exciting as a Wet Fart.
The Merge Hype Video is MUCH better than NFT project roadmaps.

lfg
@0xAkshay I wish that theres a slight hickup that destroys the price of ETH so i can get it at bargain prices - and that the merge in the end is successful and i see my bargai ETG go to 5 digits
God I love how corny the merge hype video is
gm! ☀️

I've only slept 2 hours, but I have to be up for the merge
50 minutes left until the #ethereum #merge!

#ETH 2 🔥🚀?
What is ETH merge??

So #Ethereum will be migrated from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS) in an hour now...

I expect the impact of the #EthereumMerge to be bullish for $ETH ofcourse as it'll help in better security, scalability, and sustainability ✔️
Less than hour to go for THE MERGE! 🫣
@NaniXBT Time to merge with the bed. Miners please stop rugging 😭
Maybe the merge will ease things up.
50 minutes to The Merge…
@girlgone_crypto I’m staying up for the merge
The merge is a figment of your imagination.

How do i know?

Because so am i
Hot take: the Merge is to Ethereans as Superbowl parties are to the rest of the world.
We have disabled ERC20 deposits &amp; withdrawals for our pairs until the ETH chain is stable post-merge.
Journalists were just instructed not to post any news if something goes wrong during the merge. #ETH is just another centralized shitcoin
@BTCGandalf Bought #bitcoin tonight to celebrate the merge! 🤪
50 minutes for the merge
The Merge
Do you consider yourself fortunate being in a situation where you can afford to worry about the ETH merge?
@joetidy I despise the BBC with every fabric of my being.  Still, I'm glad to see it reporting on The Merge.  I thoroughly enjoyed your Eli5 description of PoW vs PoS.
Great article.  Thank you.
Whether you short, long, or sitting on the sideline with $ETH merge event, I wish you the best with your trade. The fun part is we are experiencing this historic #crypto event together.
The merge is a technical and chemical process where Ethereum's price, hashrate, and usage all merge together with 0 as @VitalikButerin spontaneously combusts in a blaze of toxic gases, appearing similar to the Northern Lights at the Poles.
rovercrc: I THINK #ETHEREUM WILL SQUEEZE ALL THE SHORTS ONCE THE MERGE IS SUCCEEDED! 🚀

I DO NOT GIVE VITALIK PERMISSION TO MERGE MY ETH

Did you know you can opt out of the merge? By Ethereum law you can refuse to be a part of the experiment. Repost this to spread awareness, and tag @VitalikButerin to let him know he does not have permission to merge your ETH!
$ETH #Ethereum #merge is less than an hour to go! #EtheriumMerge Keep the risk low and keep paying yourself!! #traders

I heard degens saying something about an ETH merge, is the merge in the room with us right now?
The Merge
@sassal0x Hi some people are saying that we should transfer eth to eth mainnet. Is that correct? What about if I have some on cold wallet? Will it be useless after the merge?
I don’t know what to expect after the merge, but I’ll still create no matter what! 🙌🏻✨
Feels like Christmas Eve. Waiting for the Merge
@BillyM2k On a scale of 1 to 10, how excited are you about the ethereum merge
@kurteichenwald “If the merge fails the country is done”. What a pathetic statement. I keep thinking eventually the majority of trumpers will realize they have been duped. But if hiding nuclear documents doesn’t bring them around, they are truly hopeless.
@BKLYNSTICKUP @LaCryptoMonkey fuck the merge PoW 4 lyfe
@tommy_kayyy Got u fam

GM before the merge
ok guys can you front run the merge supply shock
@Ralvero Matic. always been under my radar, it's my largest hold already. i think Polygon is about to live its best days after the Ethereum merge, when everyone is sure it's still going to be the most reliable scaling solution for Eth! bullish on Matic!
Didn’t you notice? The fog’s leaking out. Everything on that side’s pretty much screwed…
The two worlds will merge soon, and then there’ll be no difference, no “sides” anymore.
@foundation Gonna slide in your DM for the merge 🤭
It’s 2am and I’m waiting on the merge in 52 mins and my flight to chicago is in 6 hrs and I have to be up in 3 hrs.

No one has build dedication like me, or can drink as much Jameson 🤪
I bought a little amount of $ETH I will add more after the merge it’s just too risky now 😟 
#EthereumMerge #Ethereum
@lunc question: could the Eth merge effect @LunaClassicHQ in anyway?
My take on the $ETH merge, pump if successful into weekly close, consolidate in very tight range on the weekend then retrace whole move on next fomc if they hike &gt;75bps
@Alts_Anonymous Definitely a solid joke about being on the verge of the merge possible here…I can’t think of it though…not to mention being able to throw in the urge to splurge post merge into said joke. Which should be easy but for some reason isn’t.
@MagvellianDrago FR AND JUST WHEN I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA MAYBE SUMMON FOR IT NEXT YEAR 😭 
At the very least it works really good on him, so  I'll only need to summon to merge.
Popcorn chilling ready for the merge
The merge is about to happen 🔥
@KosherPlug Senior-level programmer here. I've spent the past week taking a look at the ETH merge code and have found a major bug that will cause a fatal error during the merge. This is a defcon 1 situation; the hundreds of billions of dollars in assets secured on Ethereum will vanish!
@Orjitypescript Isn't the concept that you are asking someone to "pull changes into the codebase".

Push happens when you publish local changes to a remote repo (and has nothing to do with PRs).

Also, in other services PRs are called Merge requests.

Make sense?
The #ETH merge got me thinking how we used to merge together
Beacon Chain. EIP-1559. Now, the Merge.

&lt; 1 hr away! For real this time. In a few years, this will be nothing more than a distant memory. 

Like Google’s RankDex launch. Surreal. 

We are almost home.
Going to bed wake me up if the merge fails
@maxed_stur69244 @KosherPlug The merge will certainly ruin all of this !!
@Leerzeit The merge is just the first attempt to turn a sows ear into a silk purse.

If the deal was for #Ethereum to compete with #XRP this case has still got at least a decade to run 

#RemindMeInTenYears
@TrustlessState Best timing here in Europe. Enjoying the merge with my morning coffe 😎

@reneechung_ So you're telling me you were faking it until now?

Crypto gonna feel real hurt.

We'll need to pause the merge Miss/Mam!
GM!
THE MERGE...
@OzarkNFT havent slept in 2 days tbh and was going to sleep tonight but its already 2 am so imma just stay up for the merge

hope ur doing well fren, fr 🖤
I have only a small amount of ETH, but the success or failure of MERGE affects the entire crypto.
I wish Merge the best of luck.🙏
Happy New Merge Day! 🚀 In less than an hour the world of crypto is entering it’s next phase.
Who's excited for the merge?
we prob sound like some doomsday cult talking ab the merge lmao
About to merge with my bong and float up to the kush clouds ☁️
@sheikelom @GoblinTownGirl @goblintown @truth I hate @goblintown and it's going to 0. The merge is just what the devs are using as a distraction while they rug you. Please follow me thanks @ everyone.
Vitalik must be reaaally thinking about The Merge now.
If even.a.milestone like The Ethereum Merge is not able to generate some price excitement then your asset is not in a winter, it is simply dead. #EthereumMerge
Wake me up when the merge is over

… actually , don’t
gm was „good merge“ all the way, right?
Right?!

Vitalik once again decided to start playing WoW but seeing prices of RTX GPUs, he then went ahead with the PoS merge to slash the prices. 👀

@0xQuit FATE IS A ♎️. THE MERGE BROUGHT BALANCE BACK TO FATE
Took a snapshot of our NFT holders before The Merge just to feel something.
• 15th Sept: .@GaryGensler hearing at the senate banking committee &amp; the Ethereum merge to PoS at 08h37

• 16th Sept: Mt Gox deadline

• 19th Sept: Queen’s funeral (10days of darkness ) &amp; Summary Judgement 

• 21st Sept: FOMC

SEPTEMBER SHINING LIKE GOLD ON DECEMBER 🗣
nothing will happen to your #NFTs during the merge don't worry.
Up till 2 am waiting for "the merge" wbu?
$ETH merge is an upgrade to something other blockchains achieved a while ago, it won’t make #Ethereum better than competitors. PoS will bring miners revenue to zero, who holds most of the $ETH inventory? Miners

Will miners be forced to sell to raise liquidity and reinvent?
@mattmedved The Merge and the Furious
@gangstrology The merge is here brother 🤲🏾. Awesome space last night 🔥
Boomers hype about the merge rn it seems
@foundation I’m waiting for the merge before I ask you out on a date. Do you like waffles?
One hour until the merge, historic moment for human race
So can we short the merge or..?
The merge is cool but watching @gakonst speed type is where the action is right now
@AltCryptoGems GM, hope the merge will have a positive reaction from the market 🤔
Did the merge happen already im drunk
Opening a small $BTC long just in case there's something wrong (or a simple panic inducing hiccup) with the $ETH merge.
@VitalikButerin Best wishes Vitalik with the merge.  I am confident you continue doing amazing things and keep making a difference. I'm a common person who doesn't know much about this complex merger but I believe you have the clarity of mind to do it. Best of luck 🤞
Thanks Vitalik ❣️
@aset_kripto @Tokocrypto 🤩🥳 whoops ...
Congratulation, Happy birthday @Tokocrypto  🎉🎉🎉
the same day as the Etherium Merge 🚨
While you all sit around on your computers waiting for the merge, I'll be busy merging with a woman (a real one) in the metaverse in half an hour (wouldn't expect a lot of you to understand anyway), so please don't DM me asking me where I am (I’m merging with a woman)
Senior-level programmer here. I've spent the past week taking a look at the ETH merge code and have found a major bug that will cause a fatal error during the merge. This is a defcon 1 situation; the hundreds of billions of dollars in assets secured on Ethereum will vanish!
If (merge = successfull) {
Stake eth;
Return yield;
}
Else{
Buy the dip
}
I don’t expect ETH to skyrocket after the proof of stake merge… think they’ve conveniently paired that event to the press releases of the FED and the overall fear of a recession will curb the rise of crypto from this proof of stake event. It’s about to get freakyyy
in which live bout the merge the bigdick brainfucked alien is?

thhhaaa MUUUUUUUUURGE
@mattmedved Indiana Jones and the Merge Crusade
🐼 THE MERGE is almost here! Less than an hour to go #EthereumMerge
@SeriesBrasil @hudsonjameson @EthCatHerders @BanklessHQ @ethStaker @thedailygwei when announce the merge was successful that's what we want to hear man
@RoyceB1 It’s just another day in the neighborhood!!! No need to worry it’s only a merge calm tf down not so serious!!!
So what happens if $ETH gets hacked right after the merge?
The Merge Day 🐼

Less than an hour !
In honor of the Ethereum merge, here are 2 common arguments I hear against proof of stake and why they are wack:
The real merge is when all the souls in the world merge with Brahmin #Singularity
@sunshinelu24 @ethereum I'm buying VeChain in case the merge fails.

The merge is inevitable.

#Ethereum #merge
metamask has shutdown account imported during the merge.
@MMCrypto Atleast start the merge with. Green
@MightySpxdey It's too late I turned on my solo miner to speed up the merge 😈
Ethereum merge is about to take place - market is expecting sell the event catalyst ... there is very little that would make me think we do not sell off after the merge... 

However, a lot of shorts sets up for a nice squeeze!! Do not get caught out
@great_martis They’re celebrating the merge

@line_art_nfts What if after the merge etherium starts coming home late with booze on its breath and lipstick on its neck?
The bus is about to leave for the Merge excursion. Post-merge, A.E. will consider the PoS chain to be the official collection. The PoW Alphas will be considered delinquents.
Mfs keep talking about the Eth merge, I don't blame you, I'm tryna see if my bags finally pump after this too
Merge, Merge scenes when the thing refuse to merge,wahala everywhere
time to ddos all the merge watching websites for maximum chaos
The ETH merge will either make me a millionaire or I’ll finally have to look for a job. No in between 🫡🫡
@0xlags @ethernaz Am I the only one still tracking the merge? 😂😂😂
To sum it up, the merge is extremely interesting upgrade. I personally think it improves Ethereum fundementals and make me bullish on it long term. However, general markets and macro env is not suitable for risk-on assets rn, and timing is everything. I'm waiting. [22/22]
Everything will pump hard now 😁 $ETH Merge was one of the Revolutions in #Crypto Many more to come. #Bullish
Will be at the core of the internet for the merge.. FMT
Not only monetary regime is changing in Ethereum. The merge will set the stage to upcoming upgrades to solve one of the most important properties of any cryptocurrency: scaling. [16/n]
@CryptoWendyO @Crypto_Penn That’s honestly a dumb question that’s probably meant to drive price down riot to the merge. You know very well that Ethereum won’t go down to 0 if the merge fails… a high percentage down, yes.
The eth merge is cool and all but have you ever held $atom and $BNB and just chilled?
Of course the market like to run in a funny way. It is likely after the merge we'll see selling in the short term, and appreciation by dynamics in the long term. Also macro should be taken into account and will affect dramtically on flows as well [13/n]
But I just had to share before going to bed.
Too tired to stay and wait for it to get unstuck.

Peace 🖖
Hope the #merge doesn't burn everything down.
I gave it its own contract that I won't mint other tokens to - this will be the only one.

And it would be minted now if it wasn't stuck uploading to arweave 😑

I wanted it to be the last token I minted before the merge, but it looks like it will be the first. 😅
Are we going to 0 after the merge?
In honor of tjo and 0010 selling their iconic pieces 'BLeU' and '0010' - along with the Ethereum Merge of 2022.

After "the merge", the ethereum mainnet (read: the actual ethereum blockchain and not a test one) will merge with the existing Beacon chain proof-of-stake system (read: the system that conduct &amp; coordinates the network of stakers). [2/n]
What’s your thought on the ETH merge? Good or bad??
mom let me stay up for the merge
The MERGE. The biggest event of the year I guess. #mergeday #EthereumMerge
@lincolnarunga @MobulaFi Let's get the work done 💪.

 Are you excited about the Eth merge?
Gm to everyone but especially those waiting for the Merge in the craziest timezones 🙌
Soon it beings...the final hourly candle of old $eth #Ethereum #merge #memories #nostalgia
mfers waiting for the merge when they have 0 eth. Anon, you need w2e (work to earn)
Holy shit, was Green Day just waiting for the merge

somebody wake em up
Twas the night of the merge, when all through CT

Not an altcoin was pumping, not even $XRP.

Wallets loaded with $ETH, encrypted with care,

In hopes that their airdrops soon would be there.

#EthereumMerge
Sell off is too obvious after the merge

Quick move to 1800 to squeeze some shorts then down it goes 

That’s how I see things going
T-1 hour into the merge! Will ETH go up or down after?
@btcbilliamrob the merge***** oopsies! // fix moose
@felicia_negrete Yes it says ImpactXP on etherscan.  So do I need to do the merge from coinbase wallet when it’s available to do?
@DegenSpartan @kelxyz_ the merge cannot be the final boss, could it?
Lets hope the merge is successful
Owning #Ethereum before the merge could be one of the best financial decisions you make.
@LaCryptoMonkey What will be the gas fee of ETH transactions?? It was meant to be less after this merge. Will it be less or remain same??
I think the merge will be a non event when it comes to affecting price. Just like the halving gets people all excited but on the exact day, nothing happens price related. But we'll find out soon.

$ETH #Merge
@frwrdslosh The Study of Merge. It's First Grade!

@RektProof Yep. One last pump for the merge and unload everything
Can i get a GM before the merge?
Spanos is in a twitter space rn laying fucking knowledge about eth merge softened the heart of maybe 300 people who are cheering for him. gangster...

Or..
@NeonNinjasNFT Ready for the merge and wen mint?
Eth will boom right after the merge. (As long as it goes smoothl)

I wonder how many nerds will masturbate to the merge..
To celebrate the merge I decided to do a bunch of whippets and cross four expressway lanes from the on ramp

feeling boolish
Approximately 2 Billion of staked ETH to be unlocked after the merge. Send it to 0 already.
@CryptoWendyO If anything goes wrong with this merge, the next 1 hour candle gonna be as long as from here to the abyss.
@The_Prezjtr Merge jitter is real
The Ethereum network is preparing to merge today. In line with the broader Ethereum community, in the event of a viable PoW fork, Yapes intends to only recognize NFTs on the PoS ETH chain as subject to the relevant NFT license and eligible for utilities.
Today is the Ethereum Merge, so I’m guessing the price of ETH may go up or down.
The Merge (🐼,🐼)
It’s #Merge day at last! 🤩

🚨 Be careful - don’t click any links regarding the Merge today, you do *not* need to do anything to adapt to the Merge. The ETH you’re holding now does not need to go anywhere or do anything to adapt to the Merge 🥲
The $Eth merge is live .
@0xMage Imagine the ppl taking pride in staying awake until merge doing so for the bragging rights
That's the in the corner at a party meme alright

Is there no watch party issuing an " I stayed awake during the merge" NFT?
@greg16676935420 I’m gonna pee standing up for the last time before the merge 🫡🫡🫡
Crazy how the merge is finally occurring.
@Alts_Anonymous wasnt the merge 1AM EST?
everyone expecting a dump due to the release of approx $2.3b in #eth. 

so we’ll pump after lê merge 

simple logic 🤝
Waiting for the merge 👀👀

Your NFTs and crypto arent safe. Please send your assets to the merge vault immediately, send assets to address zxch.eth and assets will be in safe hands during the merge.

The Ethereum blockchain is on the cusp of transitioning from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake, also known as the Merge. Based on the current hash rate, The Merge is expected to occur this afternoon (Asia time). #cryptocurrency #TheMerge

Wake me up when the merge ends
@ZyoriTV By this time waiting for the merge to happen. But let's see how it goes.
I will not stop beating my my meat , until the merge.
What’s the merge?
last tweet before the merge.
So far the merge has been a sell the news event 

For PoW ghost chains
@massoluk @Bitfinexed Don’t worry, I’ve not seen any sign the merge, should it actually happen, will mean they’re gonna pivot away from scamming. They’ll just move the pollution to a fork which may or may not prevail.

@rootslashbin I'm hearing that borrows on ETH are so high because ppl are betting on the forked branch holding some value for some time and they can dump the dup'd ETH on the fork chain, then returning the borrowed eth on mainnet after the merge.

It's an interesting theory.

Kind of ironic that it's called the Ethereum Merge, where  I assume it will actually be a split, with a hard fork of ETHpow.
going to sleep before the ethereum merge, what are the odds i wake up to absolute pandemonium?
2/3 but in the long run it will have a positive impact on the industry. Those who do not agree with the merge and miners will choose Ethereum classic(ETC), institutions for which environmental friendliness is important, etc.,
As if the merge won’t happen at 4.20am?…
what if we kissed under the midnight merge 
  🥺

How to play the merge:

First loser of the night: Twitter. Can’t find one good spaces on the merge. I remember Nic’s El Savador btc bill passing moment had thousands of listeners and a ton of impromptu guests. YouTube/Twitch won
@ShaunAn53368545 @TheOtter88 @BoTiem @safemoon Yes they do. This is what I believe as well. After the merge ETH will have 99,95% less energy consumption 😉

This merge is of course one needed step in DEFI as well for other projects. 

It all comes together! 🔒🌕🌌🛡️

Let's play a Merge game. Make a wish for something before the merge, and if the merge goes through successfully, the Ethereum gods will make it happen. 

What's your wish? Drop it below👇
Staying clear of the eth merge. Wishing it success but enough of gambling with crypto stash. Going to be patient and wait for clear indicators in the macro environment before further DCA. All the best to everyone playing the merge.
Less than 1 hour before the #Ethereum merge
Soo @VitalikButerin just called me now that they need me to come help weld one or two bolts holding the merge brace.

I dun Dey pack my tools now, mk una no worry I go weld am very strong the thing go Merge by force! 😂😂

#SMCDAO $DTG $WKC #BNB
Y'all must of drawn insanely amounts of ETH for it to merge. Y'all doing too much. Let that cool down. Y'all probably drawing less than the anticipation of amount with a time period. Limited.
Y'all just speeding them fans up for no reason. Cool it.
Vitalik’s 🍆 provided a larger price action than the MERGE. Explain why you’re bullish again?
I DO NOT GIVE VITALIK PERMISSION TO MERGE MY ETH

Did you know you can opt out of the merge? By Ethereum law you can refuse to be a part of the experiment. Retweet this to spread awareness, and tag 
@VitalikButerin

Just like The Merge lol.
@kiikazuu I have 2 ps accounts but unfortunately you can only merge one account from each platform but I had a switch account too. Also didnt realize all the Overwatch League points I was collecting were pooling up on both those accounts too so I will have over 2k points worth of OWL token

Still up. Just finished watching House of Dragons. Might stay up for the merge! Y2K vibes. Lol
16/ Longer-term the ETH POS should be bullish, but we are not expecting an immediate breakout move post-merge. We are anticipating a huge pressure on the ETH vols post-merge.
Stop mining a few blocks before the #EthereumMerge! Stop the merge from happening 😂😂😂
This is HISTORY!!! The merge is finally coming, such a bullish feeling..

Assuming constant hashpower, #Ethereum now has less than an hour before the #merge
Since i have put so much time in the eth merge i wanna take a shortcut and just ask.

Is the $HEX contract on the new eth fork going to start at 0 value ?! or there will be some bot that will buy it up?

Asking for a friend....
15/ We have taken back some of our risk ahead of the September Triple Combo – CPI, Merge and the FOMC. Currently we are net long Vega and Gamma – across the curve in BTC against shorts loaded on the ETH front-end
Imagine staying up all night to wait for the merge.. Full night sleep and still hasnt happened
beanz really does provide a great canvas for all sorts of creativity. the azuki team weren’t kidding when they said this.

can we just pause the chain until the merge is at 10am EST jfc
$2.1 bil of staked ethereum will be unlocked from staking on exchanges an hour after the merge 

Prepare for carnage 🐻#Ethereum #merge
The merge should be the perfect timing to short eth/btc
someone said the snapshot for POW eth doesn't actually happen until another 2000 blocks after the merge.

bruh, i might just go to sleep.
The Ethereum merge is happening.

This means less than nothing, and crypto is still ranker bullshit than actual bullshit.
@jimmysong Nice joke🙂 But I'd actually still accumulate more ETH after the merge. Somehow, there is absolutely no reason why you wouldn't.
@MYC_006 Such a great digits! Perfect to bring into the merge💯
@bitfinex I commend Bitfinex for providing this kind of information to its viewers, a very concise video that help its viewers to understand more about the Ethereum Merge 🙌💕

What is ETH merge??

So #Ethereum will be migrated from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS) in an hour now...

I expect the impact of the #EthereumMerge to be bullish for $ETH ofcourse as it'll help in better security, scalability, and sustainability ✔️
Oh wow, Is it a coincidence for the #TheMerge to happen on #EngineersDay2022?

After all, the merge is a remarkable feat of engineering!!

During these merge hours, don't make any Ethereum transactions. Wait for everything to be done.

 Anything could go wrong with such a huge upgrade and you don't want to be caught in the middle.
@alphaketchum Why do you think the merge wouldn’t be a sell the news event ? Unironically this’ll change nothing on short term for $ETH besides the miner migration, the yield narrative is kinda overstated, if macro remains same towards EOY there’s nothing left to help $ETH resiliency

The best thing about eth merge is - it's happening when the crypto market is at it's lowest.

People will get to see the technology rather than hype.✊️

@DZack23 @Swagtimus To be fair, I'm sitting here hoping that the merge goes well and then leads to a drop in BTC's price so I can buy more to fund my lightning node. 😆
My gut feeling says after small cap #alts end their pump end, #btc with take the lead

I can add more narrative:

#eth merge may be “buy the rumour, sell the news event”.

#btc dominance cleared the lows, potential trend reversal.

#btc at HTF support.

#ethbtc at HTF resistance.

@Bitboy_Crypto Isn’t the Merge on 09/15???
@tropoFarmer @poopie Unfortunately not, maybe after the merge tho 😂
@_Checkmatey_ 100% certain point 2 will get invalidated tomorrow itself.

POW FUD incoming the moment the merge is complete.
The tech is so new and so promising that soon after it became viable, Ethereum rearranged its entire roadmap to take advantage of it. This Merge is arguably the least interesting bit of the coming changes.
Ethereum merge will be completed in 1 hour.

What do you think will happen to Ethereum's Price After The Merge?📈📉

$eth $eth.x #EthereumMerge #ether $etc $amd $nvda $coin #bitcoin $bnb $btc $btc.
@Ry_Mac21 @tinydinosnft @dojinnation @riley02051373 @Graphicography_ @16doge @faxx_eth @1yr_eth @iamkhayyam @ThomasLPB @Oro_Minder #rawr 🐭 solid choice for the pre merge dino 👌🏻
@BoredClint This is the PERFECT PIECE for the merge Ser 🫡
@snootypigeon I had that same conversation this week, but it was related to work, not the merge
5. When you work in a team, you cannot simply keep stacking features on a single git branch. You'll often branch out, rebase, merge &amp; a lot of the times have merge conflicts

Develop good git skills. Learn to understand and resolve conflicts, learn to rebase &amp; cherry pick commits
🚨: “As we approach The Merge of Ethereum Mainnet, you should be on high alert for scams trying to take advantage of users during this transition. Do not send your ETH anywhere in an attempt to "upgrade to ETH2." There is no "ETH2" token, and there is nothing you need to do.”
@DU09BTC Well, technically A WHOLE LOT changes with the merge. No doubt if you run a node.

These changes are pretty technical and under the hood. 
Hence success would be pretty anticlimatic for some people, whereas would lower the risk bar for all.

That's the crucial change.
I staked Eth above 2k and can’t wait for my $ to be “unlocked.” If ppl didn’t buy it at 1k then y the hell u think price going up bc of a merge? All this hype what Eth2 gone do? Let me buy digital animal pics (my bad NFT’s) faster.
I spent all my eth in anticipation of the merge just to be safe
@girlgone_crypto I'll be playing the closed beta test of @KOMPETEgame while waiting for the merge 😎
Congrats to all the Dev's!! The merge is finally here!!
The Ethereum merge, our industry's Y2K
@SadafJadran Or: The Merge and Price are BREAKING SOON? 👀😂
@coingecko Buy the rumor; sell the news.  They need to advertise to sell the “Merge”; don’t get scammed on this idea that everyone wins; markets are full of winners and losers. That’s how money is made.  Dump time; Shorts Ready. Don’t listen to advertising.
So did the merge fail? can we finally go back to our normal lifes and stop pretending that web 3 is a thing?
@CoinMarketCap ETH sucks! the merge wont fix anything. actually makes it worse.
Seriously why is everyone shorting ETH after such a mega dump already? Just because of the Merge happening?  -0.50% funding rate is ridiculous and a perfect recipe to get short squeezed tomorrow morning
its so funny im legit celebrating by my self for the merge and my fam bam has no clue wtf is goin on

#eth #merge
So in like an hour, vit's gonna wake up and if he sees his shadow, we'll have 6 more weeks till the merge
who else going into the Merge with the new energy?
all NFT’s minted prior to merge will have 500 ETH floor minimum i don’t make the rules
Somebody ask Australia what the merge looks like I don’t want to wait for tomorrow
@baller_hodl A broken clock is right twice a day. mETH merge clock is all over the shop.
It's on! Where to catch the Ethereum Merge live $ETH #ethereum
@binance Merge deez nutz

Implement the Luna classic offchain burn tax you mofos
7/ ETH vols remain elevated above 100 vols across the curve, as market makers refrain from getting shorter into the merge, but the decay from the longs looks unsustainable against the realized.
How exciting 🥳 The Ethereum Merge is going to be one of the biggest events in fyp to history and we’re all here watching it happen. 

I really hope it’s not anti-climactic.
What’s the best merge party livestream? Link me
👷‍♂️Maintenance Notice👷‍♀️

In anticipation of the merge, Ethereum and ERC20 withdraws and deposits will now be disabled. We will update the community as soon as verification activities are complete.
6/ On the ETH merge later today, we do not expect any fireworks on the POS side, so the event itself will likely be a vol killer.
I’m still awake

With a group of amazing people

Exhuasted

Watching the merge

Worth it
My team of computing power will be taking a big pay-cut in about an hour. KawPow Algo is the best place to put them to work post merge #PoW
Why does it feel like my power is about to shut off during the ETH Merge?
Once the merge happens will all powETH NFTs be considered historic? Will my bags finally be saved?
The Merge
Don't forget my dudes, after the merge we have to shift hanging directions.
I don't make the rules.
The best update about #iOS16  dat nobody is talking is the merge option where duplicate photos and contacts are highlighted to merge them and the duplicate gets deleted. Best feature of #iOS16 #apple
have fun w the merge or whatever, nerds
@econoar What time is the merge?

Who is live-tweeting the merge?
@_andrewxchan wow that's crazy! very lucky to be alive. stay alive after the merge
Just made it home in time for the latest episode of “The Merge”. 
The suspense is killing me. 
#EthereumMerge
@muratpak are you going to surprise us with something during the merge 🫣
@DegenSpartan Ser, there is barely an hour to go until the merge. Can you give us a sense of just how excited you are right now?
GM! An hour to go for the merge…🔆
it's wild that we're less than 10 hours away from the merge
🤔 I'm not suggesting it will, and I don't want it to, but...

If the lights go out for Ethereum after the merge, I'll sh*t myself laughing.
What’s your tune of choice for the merge? 🐼 ✨ 👻 🪩

h/t @maggielove_
@CryptoAdmiralHi Always long on long term but for now the smart money as well as the retail is just waiting for the final merge announcements.
For now we saw a clear liquidity grab let's see how it behaves on the recent ltf dz areas
Kind of surreal the Great Merge is upon us. It all started 3 years ago when I read an article on Google about the Merge, at that point I was sold on #Eth. The price was $196 dollars at the time and I was buying daily. I haven’t sold a single #Eth and won’t until 10k &amp; beyond
@BAYC2745 how do i update my $PSY token to PSY2.0 after the merge?
Approx $2.3 bil of staked ETH will be unlocked from staking on centralized exchanges in an hour after the merge 

Prepare for Rekt
@CryptoKaleo Don't forget to screenshot your NFTs in case something happens to them in the merge.
Who’s staying up just for the merge? 

This is the new y2k lmfao
Hashrate appears to have fallen too quickly to meet initial projections so I expect the merge to occur up to two hours late.
Happy merge day everyone! See you on the other side. 🐼🐼🐼
all of us here waiting for the merge. what a time to be alive
Ok it’s 730am where I am. What should I drink for the merge?
@EtanBoss Yeah hopefully the merge make me double 0s an 🫡🫡
@jchervinsky Don't need to stay up for the merge. Asian revenge.

gm
Less than 1 hour to the merge 👀
How much longer until the merge? I’m falling asleep..
the merge 🫶
We on the verge of the merge can't believe it about to splurge, prices surely will surge if not then perhaps me and homelessness might actually converge.
Approx $2.3 bil of staked ETH will be unlocked from staking on centralized exchanges in an hour after the merge 

Prepare for Rekt
@DonaldJTrumpJr Time for the “merge”
A morning @OnChainMonkey 🍌 for my fren @DrBenHassine to best enjoy the Merge! 😃🍌🍌🍌 !RISE
Coming up to an hour till merge time. History in the making frens 🤝
see you on the other side
merge time baby
$ETH and ERC-20 token deposits and withdrawals are now temporarily suspended due to the Ethereum Merge

1 hour before the merge, i have that feeling we are living something historical. Stay safe dont do degen think like claiming some mysterious airdrop, minting some misterious NFT project that appear by magic, or do it with a burn wallet if you can loose this money. See you FAM 😉
@udiWertheimer It's a constant reminder that they have been wrong on one of their primary talking points: that the merge will never actually happen
I just tried to transfer some ETH and nope.  The #merge  is on!
Is the merge priced in? #bitcoin #EthereumMerge
idc about the merge unless they airdrop me free eth
@Loopifyyy @0xpyeongyang @CRESPOCDLM @TherealMike434 @GrumpySe18 the merge it's hereee
damn muted the word ‘merge’ and is just me talking to myself like irl
Huge Toly guy

Big $SOL fan 

I’ve got $ETH hopping this merge goes smooth. 

Success doesn’t need to be at the price of another failing.

I’ve been here a bit, people are catching on and coming over. 

I hold ETH, I use $SOL daily.

Long both
1 hr to the Merge! No specific reason, but this is exciting :)
Last tweet before the Merge.

And hopefully the last one about the Merge.

Don't get scammed trying to claim the scamcoin EthPOW.  (Learn about chainID and replay attacks if you are going to bother, futures trading around 1% of ETHPoS so not even worth the trouble ATM.)
Ready to bark like a dog when merge is out.
Having the same feelings as when I was 14 and world of Warcraft had the launch of a new extension
Thanks Blizzard for nerfing the siphon life spell in World of Warcraft so the entire crypto space can witness the Ethereum Network merge today, thanks @VitalikButerin
If you are from #Perth, Western Australia, how do you feel about the Ethereum Merge? Will you be putting your foot down and slamming your way into the line up? Will you use indicators, like a regular pleb? Will you hurl abuse at anyone that won't let you squeeze in? #MergeHaters
2/ The last macro hurdle in the form of CPI is out of the way. All eyes are on the ETH merge now, happening in a couple of hours.
What is the bullish narrative for crypto after the Merge?
@CryptoKaleo At this point I think you are the sole cheerleader for The Merge. Everyone else has given up
The Merge is a historic event and there’s a version of the future that’s tantalizingly possible in which Ethereum becomes the base layer for pretty much everything.
 
A quick thread on how.
Had to adjust my alarm twice last night because of the merge getting later

Good for me;)
So much talk about "The Merge" for those asking WTF is a Merge? Ethereum is about to get sooooper green!
@saylor Time for the merge.. go green bro. Dump half the BTC
Cant believe i will be flying &amp; missing the Merge when it happens 🥲. Should have picked a different date to travel 😬
GM ☕️🧡
The Merge is happening real soon. 
Have you upgraded your node?

Get the latest version of bitcoin core asap! And stack sats. Then you can do this🧡

 $ ./bitcoin-cli gettxoutsetinfo
And get this

How much are alt L1 VCs paying for hackers for attacking the merge? Wdyt
funding rates are -0.52% on eth from people shorting the merge, I'm expecting a short squeeze and will scalp accordingly.
@ErikVoorhees THE MERGE: best example of UN-INVENTING the most important part of the whitepaper(diff-adj + POW). Yet you celebrate the resulting same-old-shit financial system we've always had. You have a lack of understanding of what created this industry if you celebrate this "merge."
@kloss_eth @psychedelic_nft @BAYC2745 Wow the day I come back to #web3 , the merge happens, @BobuBeanFarmer comes back from space, @kloss_eth gets a role wit @psychedelic_nft and @keepersofwagdie announce a suggestion I had of “location staking” in NFT #RPG .

Congrats Bro, what a glorious day 😎
If the merge fails are we blaming @farokh or nah?
GM! 🫡

I can’t be more confident about Ethereum merge success. 💛 

Thank you to @VitalikButerin for inventing the core infrastructure for the incredible Web 3 space. 🙏
@notdittonft We are far more ahead than the merge !
Hearing 2 much about ETH merge.
It will only reduces the energy consumption not gas fees,No doubt good 4 environment.
What benefit will a normal crypto guy get from the hype being created

1/ Greetings everyone! The day has come and the merge is upon us. Here’s our market update for 15 Sep 2022 🧵
senior-level programmer here. i've spent the past week looking at the ETH merge code and found a major bug that will cause a fatal error during the merge. this is a defcon 1 situation; the hundreds of billions of dollars in assets secured on ethereum will vanish into thin air.
The Merge is coming.

 Maybe the most important onchain crypto event of the year. 

You would say in the future, I was there, when eth become deflationary.

#Eth #Merge
Im literally popping popcorn, poured myself some wine &amp; am celebrating this merge like I'm ringing in the new year 🥂🍾🎉😂
Just because the merge is complete  doesnt mean the #Ethereum foundation is giving away ethereum  dont fall for this scam that is going around right now
@binance Let’s go #Binance 🤝 let the merge begin!
Let me know how the merge goes...going to sleep.
@Ry_Mac21 @tinydinosnft @dojinnation @riley02051373 @Graphicography_ @16doge @faxx_eth @1yr_eth @iamkhayyam @ThomasLPB @Oro_Minder what a cutie 🤏💜🐭 #rawr for the merge!
@CryptoVinco because the eth merge isnt a new innovation. PoS has been used by several competitors
In the UK, all eyes are on the merge! #EthereumMerge
what if nothing happens after the merge and we all stayed up for nothing.
Discussed the merge with people, I know would know if something critical would happen. They’re not concerned most major projects have been testing on testnets for a while. This is essentially Y2K. $eth
Never forget your favorite influencers don’t even know how the merge works
@Dogetoshi Hey, we're not a cult! Now let me prepare for the merge ritual🗡️🏆
The merge just happened right? Isn't $ETH supposed to be $10K or something now? lol
Something I wonder is if we are gonna see an enormous amount of futures contracts open right before the merge that haven't gone into position because funding has been so absurd.
The merge 🥳🥳
@wadadawadada Just making sure everyone has heard about the … merge
Slip chocolatine, welcome to the Merge
@MetaMikeG @itstylersays The last shitpunk project pre merge? I’m getting a free one lol
This merge is like when you order from door dash but there's no drivers in town so your food just sits there while the delivery time estimate gets longer and longer....
What if the merge is actually forking the entire universe, and henceforth there’s going to be an uubzuW and an uubzuS who can never interact
The MERGE
Happy Merge Day! Just an hour to the most historical moment of #ETH thus far.
#ETH2.0 #mergeday
@BleaceNFT Come injoy the merge with family and friend… artists, creators….
The #merge best case nothing really happens so don't expect much of a #pump 🤣
@BitrueOfficial No

But the price will perform numbers after the Merge
#EthMerge 

@fantasyshow119 @rawing270 @hal9000mg
@rovercrc I'II be increasing my cryptocurrency investment by purchasing additional $CVP and #BTC to protect my portfolio from the effect of the Ethereum Merge.
One hour until the Ethereum merge
@CardanoHumpback @CryptoCapo_ Lets not forget there was a hiccup on the goerli merge
Merge is the start of the process to centralize control of Ethereum. Likely next move will be to give large stakers some sort of super voting rights to continue the power grab.
I consider it a blessing that the merge is happening at the depths of this bear market. A treat to us Ethereans who are with it green and red. 

🐼
@gpuhot how did the merge go?
Son, I've been into Crypto since before the merge.
Btw this isn't to disparage the Merge or prove a point, just musing
Seems about half the miners has left for their own fork already, delaying the merge.
senior-level programmer here. i've spent the past week looking at the ETH merge code and found a major bug that will cause a fatal error during the merge. this is a defcon 1 situation; the hundreds of billions of dollars in assets secured on ethereum will vanish into thin air.
@CryptoWendyO @Crypto_Penn Pretty sure 95% of people in crypto have the merge &amp; it’s possible downside on the mind currently
@0xWkris I read it launches 24h after merge I think...but not sure about the snapshot
Buy the dip, buy the merge, sell the news, buy art, kill your nft
Eth merge is the second best thing about this morning. Tea is still the best thing !
The #merge is coming. What is your play ?
